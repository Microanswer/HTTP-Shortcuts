<h1>(Mounted) Directories</h1><p>Some features in the app allow interaction with your device's file system. For example, you can configure your shortcuts to store the response into a file (via the &quot;Response Handling&quot; screen). For this, the app needs write access to a directory, which is where the &quot;(Mounted) Directories&quot; screen comes in. Here, you can <em>mount</em> a directory, i.e., create a connection to a specific existing directory on your device and granting the app the permission to read and write files in it.</p><p>In the future, there might be more features that make use of this, but for now it's just for the storing of HTTP responses.</p><p>You can revoke access by deleting the directory from this screen. This will not affect the real directory or its contents, only the connection to it.</p>
